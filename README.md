# max1220.de CSS

This is the GitHub repository for my small CSS framework,
intended for use on my website([max1220.de](https://max1220.de)).

Also included is a small Bash script to concatenate and minify the CSS files.

For some documentation view `index.html` in a browser.

You can start a local development setup(including live) reload using the `./start_dev`
script if you have `inotifytools` and `busybox`(for it's httpd) installed.
